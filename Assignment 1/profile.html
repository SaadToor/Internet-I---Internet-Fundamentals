		Aspirations is one of the biggest part of growing up for a student or even a child. What are<br>
		some of my aspirations you may ask? One of the biggest dreams that keep me going is this<br>
		program being completed. My main goal is to finish this program with a decent GPA, and move<br> 
		on to University. Through University I would like to complete game programming and start a<br>
		job as soon as possible (ASAP).<br>
		<br>
		I am trying to study hard and do the best I can do in all of my classes. I also respect teachers as<br> 
		much as possible, and even try to make some professors my friends. During high school I have<br> 
		never disrespected a teacher or any staff/ faculty members; instead show my ability by coming<br>
		to class on time or early every day, and taking notes for further test/quizzes.<br>
		<br>
		Playing games is one and the only biggest hobby I have for my spare time. Now college started I <br>
		don’t get much time to play, but instead developed a new interest into programming. Now I<br> 
		enjoy programming and gamming, so I figured, might as well combine the both and do game <br>
		programming. If I cannot do game programming then my other goal would lead to software<br>
		development, where as I will search for companies that can hire a student straight from University.<br>
		<br>
		Hopefully one day, I will have enough experience to startup my own company and team of<br> 
		game programmers, which a lot of people will enjoy playing. I also hope to go somewhere else,<br> 
		such as, great Brittan or Dubai, or any other place. One of companies I would like to get in<br> 
		after completing University, would be Mojan, or UBISOFT. Mojang creates one of my most liked<br> 
		games which would be, Minecraft. UBISOFT creates various games, and mostly adventure, or action.<br>
		<br>
		Applying for a job for these companies require allot of experience and high areas of study. <br>
		Creating phone apps or games are much easier to develop than original PC, console games. I <br>
		don’t enjoy much other things in life such as, going outside, or traveling hours in the car<br>
		/plane/boat, or even sometimes playing sports.<br>
		<br>
		Most that matters for me know is my career in this course and then what’s going to happen <br>
		after graduation. I find this semester really challenging and difficult, but I will not <br>
		give up, I will continue to finish this course.<br>
